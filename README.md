# P2-B211
2nd Semester Project


Using DJITelloPy library, but had to erase the __init__ and __UDP_state_receive__ methods for it to not clash with our networking sockets.
GitHub won't allow us to have that library in our repository, so you'll have to find that yourself and get rid of those methods.
